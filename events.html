      <p>
        This coming Friday, we are going to host a live broadcast of a memorial for all the people around the world that
        have died as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. We will always be here for each other. In this world of
        technology, even though we are forced to stay at home, we - your family, friends and all other loved ones - are
        here for you and are there if you need us. You are not alone.
      </p>

        If you're reading this, you're alive. Let's come together in this time of strife and struggles and celebrate
        that we are all here. To those who have lost loved ones, we'll keep in mind and hope that you'll be able to get
        through the pain and the grief and that you never forget those who were so important in your life that you've
        remembered them even though they're gone.

        Mzamomtsha Primary School is proud to declare that we will be hosting a forum for anyone that wants to share
        anything about COVID-19 or ask any questions so that we all can become informed together. If you have any
        questions, you can post them on Twitter and tag them as #coronaaintamystery. Everyone's welcome, so please join
        us. COVID-19 has hit us all hard, and while we are happy to help gain knowledge, we would also like our students
        to learn. If anyone is willing to donate to our solidarity fund, we would love it.
