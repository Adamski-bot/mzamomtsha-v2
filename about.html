                    <p>Our mission at Mzamomtsha Primary is to promote a love of learning and of life. While we truly
                         believe
                         that knowledge is power, we - as a school - also recognise that it requires a lot more than
                         knowledge to create a generation that will surpass their predecessors. Because of this, we have
                         chosen to nurture our students in the various ways of life. We hope to instill the core values
                         of
                         this school into our learners. Respect, tolerance, inclusion and excellence are values that we
                         have
                         and will always embody and share through our students and staff.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                         The vision of our school is simple: it is to create lifelong learners with the skills and
                         mindset to pursue their aspirations and contribute to the world.

                         <p class="answer">A: As a school, there is always something that we could use money to obtain
                              to make our learners live better. Many of our students come to school, hungry and
                              sleepless because of home situations. With the money received from donations, one of our
                              most important purchases would be that of food as well as that of staff, which will allow
                              the quality of our learners' learning and education to improve.

                         <p class="answer">A: At the moment, the Mzamomtsha Primary School has limited classrooms which prevents us from expanding to include high school classes. We also lack teachers that are capable of teaching our classes.</p>
