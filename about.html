                    <p>Our mission at Mzamomtsha Primary is to promote a love of learning and of life. While we truly
                         believe
                         that knowledge is power, we - as a school - also recognise that it requires a lot more than
                         knowledge to create a generation that will surpass their predecessors. Because of this, we have
                         chosen to nurture our students in the various ways of life. We hope to instill the core values
                         of
                         this school into our learners. Respect, tolerance, inclusion and excellence are values that we
                         have
                         and will always embody and share through our students and staff.</p>
                    <p>The vision of our school is simple: it is to create lifelong learners with the skills and mindset
                         to
                         pursue their aspirations and contribute to the world.</p>
